// 1. Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").
const userInput = 18
let result

// 2. Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.
result = 18 + userInput

// 3. Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and dividing it).
result = result - 6
result = result * 27
result = result / 4

// 4. Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change?
// No, the userInput value doesn't change.

// 5. alert() the result and the user input variables (in two separate alert() calls).
alert(result)
alert(userInput)
